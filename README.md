The project focuses on low-rank approximations through different techniques. The folders "testbild_snapshots" and "roundabout_snapshots" contains the images for which we conduct the low-rank approximations.
The last part of the project uses the Zalando MNIST dataset, here we also employ Interpolative decomposition.
